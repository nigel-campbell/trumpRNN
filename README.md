# trumpRNN

The current, 45th president of the United States Donald J. Trump is known to be a frqeuent tweeter. He also tweets with mistakes/misspellings (e.g. hamberders), and with a colloquial tone that's iconic and rather unique. 

Given the wealth of data and prominent position as the president of USA, it'd be fun to use Deep Learning to create "fake Trump". 

We will use archived version of Trump's tweets from 2013-2019 as the input data. 
We will use RNN (LSTM/GRU) as the basis of the model. 

Finally, for evaluation, we will use a similairty index to compare how close our "fake tweets" are to the actual tweets.
